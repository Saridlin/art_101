          <h5 id="ex3"> Exercise 3 </h5>
          <p>
            For Exercise 3, I decided to recreate the Roomba, the vacuum robot, as my creature.
            <br>
            The roombas are drawn using the <i>ellipse()</i> and <i>arc()</i> functions and can have modular accessories added to them, also made with
            vector-based graphics. The tables that can be seen in the room also function as another "creature" with options to have a table setting
            or bouquet placed on top. 
            <br> This behavior was achieved using a parent-child function hierarchy:<br>
            <b>Parent Functions</b> - <i>doRoomba()</i>, <i>doAddTable()</i><br>
            <b>Child Functions</b> - <i>doAddSpoon()</i>, <i>doAddKnife()</i>, <i>doAddHat()</i>, <i>doAddPlate()</i>, <i>doAddFlower()</i><br>
            The child functions of <i>doAddSpoon()</i> and <i>doAddKnife()</i> are shared between <i>doRoomba()</i> and <i>doAddTable()</i>.<br>
            <br>
            As the program runs, the Roombas travel and bounce across the digital living room. The first two roombas generated are also 
            able to interact and bounce off of each other. This was achieved through utilizing <i>translate()</i> and a custom <i>move()</i> function 
            that would change the position determined by individual x and y-axis speed variables for each roomba. These speeds are also used 
            in a <i>atan2()</i> calculation inside <i>doRoomba()</i> to <i>rotate()</i> the creature to face "forward" as if it is looking ahead while it moves. Both the roombas 
            and the tables also have options in their function parameters to change the scale. <i>scale()</i> is also used to reflect the accessories on the roombas to 
            display on the opposite sides.

          <p>
            For this exercise, I converted my creature (Roomba) to a Class Object with its own action methods that could be 
            called to manipulate its behavior on the canvas. I displayed a crowd of these creatures on the canvas by creating an array <i>roombas</i>, that held all my Roomba objects. 
            The constructor my Roomba Class only asks for a color() object, name string, scale size and item string. The position, speed, 
            and other properties are determined through random() or calculations using the scale given and inherent size of a Roomba object.
            The display methods for my Roomba class are: <i>update()</i>, <i>addHat()</i>, <i>addKnife()</i>, <i>addSpoon()</i>, and <i>toString()</i>. The action methods are: 
            <i>setColor()</i>, <i>setAngle()</i>, <i>dance()</i>, <i>rainbow()</i>, <i>move()</i>.<br>
            <br>
            I also added 4 other creature Classes from my classmates: Amogus (by Dat) dgCentipede21 (by David), ibgFace (by Lyndon), and Kirby (by Angie). These creatures were also 
            spawned using Arrays and for loops to hold 15 of each type. I then used each creatures' display method and any action methods if available to have them move on the canvas.

          <h5 id="p2"> Project 2</h5>
          <p>
            For Project 2, I combined the Flocking algorithm with the Recursive Tree and my own Blooming 
            animation to create a branching and weaving visual. The animation begins with a slowly growing 
            tree that then releases elliptical creatures to flock around the canvas. Floral patterns bloom 
            in the background during these first two acts. In the third act, the creatures start to leave a 
            permanent trail and weave together their paths of travel almost filling the space completely. In 
            the fourth and final act, the creatures become colorful, grow in size and speed. They flock back 
            together and create a river of rainbow hue to finish the animation. The background music comes from 
            <a href="https://ncs.io/timeline">OBLVYN - A Mere Blip In Your Timeline released by NoCopyrightSounds</a><br>
            I reworked each algorithm from p5.js into its own class: 
            <a href="https://archive.p5js.org/examples/simulate-recursive-tree.html">Recursive Tree</a> - <i>doTree()</i>, <a href="https://archive.p5js.org/examples/simulate-flocking.html">Flocking</a> - <i>doFlock()</i> and <i>doBoids()</i>.<br>    
            <i>Bloom()</i> depends on direct canvas elements and can be seen in the <a href="p5_code/project_2/sketch.js">sketch.js</a> code.<br>
          </p><p>
            Figuring out how to convert the algorithms to classes that I could use was an interesting challenge, 
            especially with the Flocking program because it uses a <i>.prototype</i> declaration in its original source. 
            The iterative process to find a generated visual was new to me as well, because it is difficult to tell 
            if the current run of the code will have a good result until the very end. I ended up running it at least 10 
            times before settling on this result.
            <br>
            The most challenging portion of this project was coming up with a way to combine the code in an interesting 
            way while also trying to understand what the code is also doing. For Flocking, each Boid (bird-like object) had 
            was controlled with 10 different methods alone. I also wanted to try and plot the end points of the Recursive 
            Tree to have the Boids spawn in from there in the second act, but recording and tracking the transformations 
            turned out to be a much more complicated mathematical process that I was not able to finish. Instead, I simulated the Boids spawning 
            off the points on the Tree through a parabola calculation that roughly follows the tree canopy.
