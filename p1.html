            This is the first exercise completed for class where I experimented with using basic drawing functions
            such as <i>rect()</i>, <i>triangle()</i>, <i>ellipse()</i>; as well as, learning new functions: <i>line()</i> and <i>point()</i>. Each 
            function is called when a certain condition is met, and it was a puzzle to figure out how to create 
            4 different states that the canvas would appear in: Triangle Idle, Ellipse Follow, Line Grid Follow, 
            and Point & Rect Idle.<br>
            Each state was achieved through the use of conditions that checked the values of global variables such
            as <i>mouseX</i>, <i>mouseY</i>, and the canvas' <i>width</i> or <i>height</i>. The behavior of each state would depend on similar
            changing counters and the statistics of the generated "wallpaper" over time is tracked through <i>console.log()</i> prints.

          <p>
            In this second exercise, I created an interactive game mimicking the classic "Snake" where the user
            controls a worm traveling across a grid to eat various fruits. I experimented with many different
            global variables that tracked the position of multiple fruits on the grid and whether the worm's head 
            collided with them. If the worm eats, it prints some text that says "NOM!" and the fruit is randomly
            generated at a new location. If the worm goes too long without eating a certain fruit, it starts to 
            complain to the user. <br>
            The game also tracks the user's key presses and mouse movements to execute different effects using
            global variable states such as <i>keyIsPressed</i>, <i>mouseIsPressed</i> and functions such as <i>mouseMoved()</i>. Through 
            this, the game has extra cosmetic interactivity to make it more visually interesting. Changes in
            variable states and counters are also pushed to <i>console.log()</i>.

          <h5 id="p1"> Project 1</h5>
          <p>
            For Project 1, I worked off of the paint program template to create a program that allows the 
            user to create and save their own works of art made in the browser. <br>    
            There are 3 different algorithmic brushes available that can be used in various ways to achieve
            a psychedelic masterpiece. There is a brush that generates a continously rotating line around the
            position of the mouse, a rainbow-shifting triangular brush, and a spotted inverted brush that interacts
            with the colors already present on the canvas. With this, a surreal artpiece can be easily created by varying
            the size of the brush as well and creatively using the solid and translucent eraser tools. <br>
          </p><p>
              The behavior of the brushes that I created were a very engaging challenge. 
              I believe that I effectively made a fun program for users to play with and make art that interacts reflectively with them.
              The basics of a drawing program are there: making a mark, erasing marks, and recording your created piece.
            <br>
            What I found most challenging about this project was deciding upon the algorithmic behavior 
            of my brushes and being able to execute what I had imagined them to be. I really had to explore the p5.js documentation to find what
            I needed and then experiment thoroughly with what I thought would work. I specifically learned how different 
            transformative functions, like <i>rotate()</i>, need a <i>translate()</i> function to function with the coordinates I wanted 
            the drawn shapes to be placed at. I also explored <i>blendMode()</i> and how <i>DIFFERENCE</i> and <i>BLEND</i> change the way drawn shapes
            affect the canvas well.
